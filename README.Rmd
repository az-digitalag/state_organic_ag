# Data and Code from: On-farm land management strategies and production challenges in United States Organic Agricultural Systems.

This repository contains data and code used in Mpanga et al 2021. 

It provides USDA Surveys of Agricultural Production from 2008-2019 to investigate state and national trends by state in organic farm area, number, and sales, as well USDA censuses from 2007 to 2017 to evaluate national trends in on-farm land-use practices and challenges facing US organic production. 

The data include state and national level measurements of organic farm number, area, and sales.

## Repository Content

### Raw Data



#### Sources of data

Farm sales, area, and number data were downloaded from the USDA Quickstats database and 
preprocessed by USDA NASS Statistician.

**Preprocessing:** Data were originally copied from TXT and PDF files provided by the USDA Organic Production Surveys, so the sources are provided below: <https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Organic_Production/index.php>.

### Derived Data

Area units were converted from acres to hectares.

Sales figures were adjusted to 2020 dollars by dividing sales for each year by the adjustment factor provided by the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI Inflation Calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm) comparing from July in year Y to July in 2020.

Farm area, number, and sales figures for 2008 were adjusted for missing data. 

**Variables:**

-   `state`
-   `year`
-   `farm_number`: number of farms
-   `farm_ha`: area of farms in hectares (ha) converted from reported areas using a conversion factor of 2.47 ha/a
-   `farm_sales`: total sales (USD); 

    | Year | $\textbf{CPI}_{Y/2020}$ |
    |------|-------------------------|
    | 2008 | 1.22                    |
    | 2011 | 1.17                    |
    | 2014 | 1.10                    |
    | 2015 | 1.10                    |
    | 2016 | 1.09                    |
    | 2019 | 1.02                    |
    




**Note:**

> "The 2014 and 2015 Organic Certifier Survey data is a tabulation of USDA-accredited organic certifiers' acreage and livestock data received. The data underwent editing, summarization, and disclosure programming prior to publishing. The 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2015 organic producer surveys as well as the 2007 and 2012 Census of Agriculture collected and published data on organic operations which had production in the reference year. The data from these programs were adjusted for non-response, misclassification, and coverage. Therefore, the certifier survey data and producer survey/census data are not comparable and data users should account for these differences whenreviewing the data. Data users should allow for differences when comparing the data between datasets including reference periods, organic definitions, and differing survey methodologies." - USDA 2016

Missing data

removed Alaska farm area for 2015; suspected to be incorrect.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- readr::read_csv('../../../derived_data/all_transformed.csv')
knitr::kable(x %>% filter(state == 'Alaska'), digits = c(NA, 4, 2, 3, 3))
x$farm_kha[x$state == 'Alaska' & x$year == 2015] <- NA

### Analysis

#### Code: in `code/` folder.

-   `01-merge_data.R` combines files from `raw_data` folder to generate `all_transformed.R`
-   `02-exploratory_analysis.R` some plots and a simple linear regression
-   `03-regression.R` initial modeling using `brms` for multivariate Generalized Linear Model with missing data

#### Bayesian Multivariate Regression Model

The cleaned and derived data of farm number, area, and sales are modeled as a multivariate normal likelihood where the expected values are a linear regression on time (year). Slope and intercepts are estimated for each response variable, and the multivariate formulation allows for estimates of covariance among the response variables. The response variables were log transformed; on the log scale, slope differences were not substantially different for each state. Therefore, the random effect of state was added to the intercepts only. Random effects were modeled as a normal distribution centered at zero and a precision drawn from a folded-t distribution. Post-sweeping was employed to maintain identifiability between random effects and the intercepts and impose a sum-to-zero constraint on the random effects. The precision matrix was drawn from a Wishart distribution, from which standard deviations and correlation coefficients among the response variables were monitored.

The model was run in OpenBUGS using the `R2OpenBUGS` package. Three chains of 4000 samples were monitored at a thinning interval of 20 to reduce auto-correlation and storage requirements. Convergence was assessed with the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic.

#### Found in `/code/BUGS/mod2` folder.

-   `mod_2a.R` contains a multivariate normal Bayesian model code
-   `01_run_model.R` modifies `all_transformed.csv`, models data with `mod_2a.R`, and produces a coda object
-   `02_check_convergence.R` visually and algorithmically inspect for convergence; produces starting values
-   `03_plot_parameters.R` plots the slope and intercept, random effects, and variance and covariance terms
-   `04_assess_fit.R` runs model for replicated data and assesses model fit
-   `fig_2a/` contains generated plots
-   `predicted_2a.csv` contains input data in long format (with missing values) and predicted values with the central 95% credible interval (complete)

#### Run the model

```{r setup, include=FALSE, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
require("knitr")
opts_knit$set(root.dir = "code/BUGS/mod2/")
```

```{r bugs-model, eval = FALSE}
source('01_run_model.R')
```


### Derived Data

### TODO

- move mod2 model output to `derived_data/ folder`
-   document unused models code/03-regression.R, code/BUGS/mod1
-   This figure from the "[Organic Farming: Results from 2019 Organic Survey](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Highlights/2020/census-organics.pdf)" and tables in the ["2019 Organic Survey
Data Release" presentation](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Organic_Production/pdf/2019_Organic_Executive_Briefing.pdf) implies that USDA has reliable, consistent data for 2008, 2014, 2016, 2019
    -   However, the available data for, e.g., 2008 (first cell of Table 1 from [USDA 2010](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2007/Online_Highlights/Organics/ORGANICS.txt))
    - total organic farms in US is 14,540; much higher than in the figure ...
    -   Have reviewed, and will assume figure is in error. Email sent to NASS on 2021-05-12

**Update from USDA**

I think the difference in numbers you are citing is whether the estimate is for all organic farms (including exempt from certification farms) or just certified organic farms.
 
The best place to retrieve the organic data is from our Quickstats database.


This query should get you there, but some of it is difficult to view over time because of the change in the scope of the survey. For example, the 2008 and 2014 surveys included all organic farms (certified and exempt), but the 2011 and 2019 survey was only for certified farms.
